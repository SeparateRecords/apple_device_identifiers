# apple_device_identifiers

A best-effort compilation of Apple's device identifiers, starting from the late
2000s.

If you notice something wrong or missing, please open an issue (or even better,
open a pull request).

## Usage from code

In Deno, you can directly import `mod.ts` (generated by `generate.ts`). This
repository is not versioned, please use a commit hash.

If you're in any other environment where importing from URLs isn't really a
thing, feel free to just vendor the _devices_ directory or _devices.json_ file.

## Contributing

_mod.ts_ and _devices.json_ are both generated by _generate.ts_. You'll need
Deno installed to run that script.

```bash
deno run --allow-read --allow-write=devices.json,mod.ts generate.ts
```

The data comes from the _devices_ directory. Edit the JSON files in there (or
add a new one!) and re-run the script to see your changes.

Since I'm probably not the only one who needs this, I'm releasing this to the
public domain.
